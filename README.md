# 🌧️ Next-Day Rain Prediction in Australia 🇦🇺

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict whether it will rain the next day in Australia. The prediction is based on a variety of weather observations collected from numerous locations across the country.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset spans approximately 10 years and includes daily weather observations from various Australian locations. The target variable, `RainTomorrow`, indicates whether it rained the following day (Yes or No). A 'Yes' value signifies that the rainfall for that day was 1mm or more.

## 📚 Source & Acknowledgements
The weather observations were sourced from numerous weather stations, with daily observations available from the Bureau of Meteorology. Definitions were adapted from the Bureau of Meteorology.
